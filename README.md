# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

## 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the survival chances of passengers on the **Titanic** using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains passenger details like age, gender, ticket class, etc. The goal is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

## 📂 Dataset
- **File Used**: `titanic.csv`
- **Source**: The dataset is available as `titanic.csv` in this repository.
- The dataset includes features such as:
  - `Pclass` (Ticket class)
  - `Sex` (Male/Female)
  - `Age`
  - `SibSp` (Number of siblings/spouses aboard)
  - `Parch` (Number of parents/children aboard)
  - `Fare`
  - `Embarked` (Port of embarkation)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy** (Data Preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (Data Visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (Machine Learning)

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
